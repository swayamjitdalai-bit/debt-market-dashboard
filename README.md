# Fixed Income & Debt Market Dashboard

Two dashboards over one automated data layer. A scheduled job pulls CD/CP/CB
Repo trades from CCIL F-TRAC and rates from CCIL's public pages into a local
SQLite database; both dashboards read from that database instead of asking you
to download and drag files.

## Run it

- **Windows**: Double-click `start_dashboard.bat`.
- **macOS**: Run `./start_dashboard_macos.sh` or double-click it.

It installs anything missing, starts the backend, and opens the browser. Leave that window open while you work.

| URL | Page |
|---|---|
| <http://127.0.0.1:5000/> | Fixed Income Closing Report |
| <http://127.0.0.1:5000/cdcp> | CD / CP Secondary Market Dashboard |

> **Do not open `index.html` by double-clicking it.** It loads over `file://`,
> where every `/api/…` call fails and nothing populates. Always go through
> <http://127.0.0.1:5000>. The page now says so explicitly if you do.

Equivalent commands, if you prefer a terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m app.ingest --days 7     # fill the database
python -m app.server              # http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Runs killed by sleep

A run interrupted by the machine going to sleep dies with exit code
`3221225786` (`0xC000013A`, `STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT`). The System event log shows
`The system is entering sleep` at exactly those times. There is **no** task time
limit — a 184-second run completed fine while the laptop was in use; a run is
simply more likely to be caught the longer it takes.

Mitigations already in place:

- The ingest **commits each instrument as it is fetched**, so a killed run keeps
  the work it had already done. A kill costs time, not data.
- `StartWhenAvailable` catches up a trigger missed while powered off, and a
  second trigger at 22:30 backs up the 19:00 one.
- An unfinished run is recorded; the next run reports
  `RUN DIED  the run started … never finished`.
- Python runs unbuffered, so a killed run leaves a log showing how far it got
  (buffered output flushes nothing and looks like an instant crash).

To stop it happening at all, allow the task to wake the machine. This needs an
**elevated** PowerShell — Task Scheduler refuses `WakeToRun` otherwise:

```powershell
$s = (Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Debt Market Ingest").Settings
$s.WakeToRun = $true
Set-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Debt Market Ingest" -Settings $s
```

### No console window

Task Scheduler runs a `.bat` in a visible `cmd` window. The task therefore
points at `run_daily_hidden.vbs`, which launches the same batch with window
style `0` and waits for it — nothing appears on screen, and the task still
reports the batch's real exit code.

Retries are set to **1**. They were 3, which meant every failed run spawned
three more windows; with two daily triggers that was up to eight popups a day.

### Knowing when a source breaks

A scraper's worst failure is the quiet one: the site gets redesigned, the parse
returns nothing, and "0 rows" looks exactly like a market holiday. Both sources
are checked structurally, so that cannot happen silently:

- **F-TRAC** — if `txtFrmDealDate`, `txtToDealDate`, `btnExprtExcel` or
  `__VIEWSTATE` are missing from the page, the run reports
  `LAYOUT CHANGED: …` and logs status `error`.
- **CCIL** — if the page loads but the table we scrape (`Type`/`Wtd Avg`,
  `Tenor Bucket`/`YTM (%)`) is not in it, it raises `LayoutError`.

Every run ends with a health summary and prints an `!! ATTENTION` block for
broken sources, trade data more than three business days stale, or missing CCIL
rates. Nothing to report means the line is silent.

### If fetch fails

Almost always the backend is not running. In order:

1. Is the `start_dashboard.bat` window still open? Closing it stops the server.
2. Is the address bar showing `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, not `file:///C:/…`?
3. Check the database directly — this needs no server:
   `python -c "from app import db; c=db.init(); print(db.trade_dates(c))"`
4. Check the last scheduled run: `data\ingest.log`.

## What is automated

Everything below is fetched with plain HTTP — no login, no browser
automation, no paid terminal.

| Field | Source | How |
|---|---|---|
| CD / CP / CB Repo secondary trades | CCIL F-TRAC | `.aspx` export form post |
| CD / CP primary issuance | CCIL F-TRAC | same |
| CALL, TREP, Basket & Special Repo — O/H/L/last/w.avg/volume | CCIL money market page | server-rendered table |
| Benchmark G-Sec curve (1-2Y … 28-30Y) + security names | CCIL indicative yields | server-rendered table |
| T-Bill 91D / 182D / 364D | CCIL indicative yields | same |
| SDL 5Y / 10Y / 15Y | CCIL indicative yields | same |
| **CD / CP yield range by tenor** | **derived** | trades bucketed by residual maturity |
| **CD / CP spread over T-Bill** | **derived** | weighted-avg yield vs comparable bill |
| **Day-on-day change (bps)** | **derived** | previous stored business day |
| **Most active issuers** | **derived** | volume-weighted, per instrument |
| USD/INR close | FBIL via Frankfurter | free JSON API |
| Brent | FRED `DCOILBRENTEU` | best-effort; see limitations |

Still typed by hand, because no free source publishes them:

- OIS curve, AAA PSU corporate spreads, top-traded G-Secs
- USD/INR open and day range
- News headlines and closing commentary

The closing report's section badges show **Auto** or **Manual** based on what
actually arrived, and say `Auto · from <date>` when a block fell back to an
earlier publish.

## The scheduled task

A Windows scheduled task named **`Debt Market Ingest`** is already registered
and runs `run_daily.bat` **daily at 19:00**, after the market closes. It pulls
the last **7 days** — the widest single export window F-TRAC accepts, so it
costs exactly the same as a one-day pull but survives a week of missed runs
(holidays, laptop off, VPN down). `StartWhenAvailable` is set, so if the PC is
off at 19:00 it runs at the next opportunity rather than skipping the day.

The task only needs the machine on and you logged in — it does **not** need the
dashboard running. It writes to the database; the dashboard just reads it.

### Windows (Task Scheduler)

```powershell
# check when it last ran and what it returned (0 = success)
Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName "Debt Market Ingest"

# run it now instead of waiting
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Debt Market Ingest"

# change the time
Set-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Debt Market Ingest" -Trigger (New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 6:30PM)

# remove it
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Debt Market Ingest" -Confirm:$false
```

### macOS (LaunchAgent)

The task runs `scripts/run_daily_macos.sh` daily at 19:00 via `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.swayamjitdalai.debt-market-dashboard.plist`.

```bash
# check status (0 = success)
launchctl list | grep -i com.swayamjitdalai.debt-market-dashboard

# run it now
launchctl start com.swayamjitdalai.debt-market-dashboard

# reload configuration
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.swayamjitdalai.debt-market-dashboard.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.swayamjitdalai.debt-market-dashboard.plist
```

Output is appended to `data/ingest.log`. Re-running any date is safe: each
source replaces its own slice rather than appending.

data/raw/                           every downloaded file, kept for audit
```

## How the F-TRAC download works

The historical-data pages are ASP.NET WebForms. Read `__VIEWSTATE`,
`__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR` and `__EVENTVALIDATION` off a GET, then post them back
with `txtFrmDealDate`, `txtToDealDate` and `btnExprtExcel=Export`. The response
is the file itself.

`__VIEWSTATEENCRYPTED` must be present in the post body (empty is fine) or the
app returns its generic error page instead of the file. The file is named
`.xls` but is really an HTML `<table>`, which is why the original dashboard
needed SheetJS's HTML sniffing to read it.

## Publishing a public link (Vercel)

```bash
python -m app.publish        # writes ./public
```

The whole dataset is ~100 KB gzipped, so the published site is **static** — no
database, no serverless functions, no API keys. `data.js` sets
`window.__STATIC_DATA__` and the dashboards' `apiGet()` reads from it instead of
calling Flask, so the published pages run the same UI code as the local server.

`public/` contains:

| File | |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Overview — headline stats, current tenor ranges, links |
| `cdcp.html` | Full CD/CP dashboard: charts, tenor cards, trade-level table, Excel export |
| `report.html` | Read-only closing report with a date switcher |
| `data.js` | The baked dataset |

### One-time setup

1. Create an empty **GitHub** repo.
2. In this folder:
   ```bash
   git init && git add . && git commit -m "Debt market dashboard"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/<repo>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. Go to **vercel.com**, sign in with GitHub, *Add New → Project*, pick the repo,
   deploy. `vercel.json` already points it at `public/`. No environment variables,
   no build command, no database.

After that the daily task rebuilds `public/`, commits and pushes automatically,
and Vercel redeploys. The link updates itself every evening.

`.gitignore` keeps `market.db`, `data/raw/` and the logs off GitHub — only the
generated site is published.

### Why not Postgres / Neon / Supabase

The data changes once a day and the entire history is ~100 KB gzipped; a year
would be under 2 MB. A database would add a second service to keep alive,
connection handling in serverless, cold starts, credentials to rotate, and a
free tier that can pause — for no gain over a file the browser downloads once.
Revisit only if the published site ever needs to accept writes.

Note that the published pages carry a CCIL source attribution and a
non-commercial notice. That is deliberate: a public link is redistribution, and
CCIL's terms restrict commercial reuse of this data.

## Charts

The CD/CP dashboard renders three charts per instrument off `/api/series/<CD|CP>`:

- **Yield trend by tenor** — volume-weighted average for 1M / 3M / 6M / 12M
- **Term structure** — the latest curve against the one a week earlier
- **Traded volume** — crore per trading day

One control row above the tabs scopes every chart (10D / 30D / All), and a
**Table** toggle gives the same numbers without hovering. Charts are
dependency-free inline SVG, so they work offline.

Series colours are categorical slots 1–4 in fixed order, one per tenor, so
changing the window never repaints a series. The palette was checked with the
data-viz validator against the white chart surface — worst adjacent pair ΔE 9.1
(protan) / 22.9 (normal vision). Two slots sit under 3:1 contrast, which is why
every line carries a direct end label and the table view exists.

## Backfilling

```bash
python -m app.ingest --backfill 30      # or any number of days
```

The export form rejects a range wider than **7 days** outright — it returns the
page instead of a file, with no warning. But that cap is on the **span**, not on
how far back you can reach: a 7-day window from six weeks ago downloads fine, at
any time of day. So `ingest` splits long ranges into 7-day windows
automatically and a 30-day backfill works whenever you run it, not just after
business hours.

USD/INR is backfilled too, since Frankfurter serves historical dates. Rates
quoted for a non-publishing day are skipped rather than stored against the
wrong date.

## Limitations worth knowing

- **CCIL rate pages publish only the last two days**, so the money market and
  benchmark/T-Bill/SDL curves *cannot* be backfilled — that history builds
  forward from the day you start running the scheduler. F-TRAC trade data and
  USD/INR have no such limit.
- F-TRAC's own stated retention is 7 days during business hours and 30 after.
  Reaching further back than 30 days has not been tested.
- **NCD trade data** is not published publicly. The endpoints exist and are
  wired up, but return no rows.
- **CB Repo has no primary market** page; only secondary is available.
- **Brent (FRED) is unreachable from this network** — every request times out.
  The field degrades to manual. If it works from another connection it will
  populate on its own.
- **Intraday**: F-TRAC serves trades as they print, so a mid-session pull gives
  a partial day. The evening scheduled run is the authoritative one.
- **CCIL terms restrict commercial redistribution** of this data. This reads
  public pages for desk use; check with CCIL before republishing.

## Notes

- `reports.db` (the original single-blob store) is migrated into
  `data/market.db` automatically on first run and is no longer written to.
- The two `.xls` files in the project root are the original manual downloads.
  Nothing reads them any more — `data/raw/` holds fetched copies instead.
- The CD/CP dashboard keeps drag-and-drop upload as a fallback for dates
  outside the F-TRAC window.

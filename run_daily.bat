@echo off
REM Daily data pull for the fixed income dashboard.
REM Fetches the last 3 days so a holiday or a late F-TRAC publish still
REM gets picked up on the next run. Re-running a day is safe -- each source
REM replaces its own slice rather than appending.

cd /d "%~dp0"
if not exist "data" mkdir "data"

REM Task Scheduler does not always inherit the interactive PATH, so resolve
REM the interpreter explicitly rather than trusting a bare "python".

REM 7 days is the widest single export window F-TRAC accepts, so this costs
REM exactly the same as a 1-day pull but survives a week of missed runs
REM (holidays, laptop off, VPN down). Re-fetching a stored day is a no-op.
REM
REM -u matters: Python buffers stdout when it is redirected to a file, so a
REM run that gets killed flushes nothing and the log shows only "^C" - which
REM reads like an instant crash rather than a timeout. Unbuffered output
REM leaves a trail showing exactly how far it got.

REM Rebuild the published site and push it, so the public link tracks the

REM Trigger the deployment explicitly. Vercel's GitHub integration on this
REM project does not rebuild on push, so pushing alone leaves the live site
REM stale. The hook always builds the latest commit on main. No-ops with a
REM note if the hook has not been configured yet.
